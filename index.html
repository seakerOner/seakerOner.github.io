        The years go by, the world changes, ideologies change, what we believe is right (or wrong) might change. 
        Me as a human I am the same, as well with the need to be remembered; and that's why this website exists, 
        a place where I can register my thoughts and projects.
        <br>

        <br>My name is <i>Seaker</i>, I started what we call programming almost a decade ago. 
        Guided by curiosity and a need for knowledge I delved into many areas of computing. From low-level Networking and protocol design, Web Development (Frontend/Backend), Systems Programming, Concurrent Systems, Interpreters, language runtimes, Compilers, Assemblers and even some Embedded Development :D. I firmly believe a <i>Software Creator</i> should not be strictly characterized by labels. Obviously, a person might specialize on one area of his interest, but one should be able to bend the machine to his will. A computer accepts instructions, we give them orders! I value explicitness, predictability, and understanding over convenience and hidden abstractions. As humans we must experience different perspectives to have a better understanding of our actions around the "ecosystem" of specialities. Funny enough, programming is like life, everything is more connected at a deeper level than it seems.
